                The museum, also known as the Jakarta History Museum,
                is located in the Old Town. The building was built in 1710.
                It has an interesting story you can learn. Previously, the
                Fatahillah Museum functioned as Batavia City Hall during the
                long colonial history under Dutch rule.

                When visiting the museum, you can find a variety of historical
                objects from the prehistoric period of the city region and the
                Dutch colonization period, until Indonesia’s Independence in 1945.
                Inside, there is an underground prison that was once used to
                imprison a Javanese freedom fighter Prince Diponegoro.

                Who doesn’t know the National Monument?
                The 132-meter tower was a Jakarta icon that symbolizes the fight for
                Indonesia. It was built to commemorate the struggle for Indonesian independence.
                Monas was built under the direction of Indonesia’s first
                president, Sukarno. The monument was opened to the public in
                1975. The historical building is topped by a flame covered with
                gold foil. From up above, you can see the beautiful skyline of
                Jakarta.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, around Monas there are also wonderful parks
                where people can use to jog around or spending
                their leisure time with family.
