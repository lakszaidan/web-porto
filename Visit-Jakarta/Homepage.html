                <p>Before we talk quite deep about what's in Jakarta, let me tell you <b>WHAT</b> is Jakarta.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b DKI style="font-size: larger;">D</b>KI Jakarta is a Capital City of Indonesia and one of the
                    biggest city is Indonesia. It is the only
                    city in Indonesia that has the status of province. Jakarta is located on the northwest coast of
                    Java.
                    Previously it was known by several names including Sunda Kelapa, Jayakarta, and Batavia. In the
                    international world
                    Jakarta also has the nickname J-Town, or more popular The Big Durian because it is considered a city
                    comparable
                    to New York City (Big Apple) in Indonesia.
                </p>
                <p>And here are few general facts about Jakarta.</p>
                <br>

                <section>
                    <h2>Multiculturalism</h2>
                    <p>Jakarta has a lot of culture, because in addition to being the capital, Jakarta is also the
                        economic
                        center of the
                        Indonesian state, therefore, the city of Jakarta is a place where residents who live outside of
                        Jakarta come
                        here to look for jobs with higher salaries, it is called <q><i>Rantau</i></q>. Some back to
                        where
                        they were but some decided to stay.
                        And those who stayed here, live here, get married, having their own descendants yet also
                        inherits
                        their own local culture. And it is also often seen that the people who did <q><i>Rantau</i></q>
                        spend more time together and got more respect to each other, even live in certain area to
                        survive.
                        Like chinese descendants live in certain area, and also ambonese. This is not a new thing
                        anymore.
                        Therefore, those are the reasons why here, in Jakarta there are many cultural fusions.
                    </p>
